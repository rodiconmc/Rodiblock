# Rodiblock
Lightweight library that allows placement of structures from Structure Block NBT files

Many of our games require structures to be placed into the world. To make this as easy as possible to save, we wanted to
use the Structure Blocks which were added in 1.10. However, there are no methods of simply placing a structure in the
world using the Bukkit or Spigot APIs. In addition, of the few libraries that exist
(mainly [StructureBlockLib](https://github.com/Shynixn/StructureBlockLib)), we found to be too over-the-top for just
simply taking a structure NBT file and placing it in the world. So we decided to make a simple function that does just
that.


What this does right now
- [x]  Reads an nbt structure file (saved from a structure block) and places it at a given location
- [x]  Can mirror in the X or Z direction

What it can't do right now
- [ ]  Place entities (because that would require NMS code)
- [ ]  Rotate (Could be added in the future.)
